 <h1><b>A Poem about waiting well</b></h1><br>
 <h2><b>In Good Times</b></h2><br>
 <h5>By Abimbola T. Alabi</h5><br>

 <p><i>Life can seem an endless maze,<br>
    The twists and turns, lulls and delays,<br>
    But things always fall into place <br>
    In good time.</i><br>
    </p> 

    <p><i>Friends will sometimes go <br>
        Some may disappoint or others betray, <br>
        But new ones will come to stay... <br>
        In good time.</i> <br>
        </p>

        <p><i>The hurt of getting something wrong, <br>
            And the lesson it often brings along <br>
            Are there, you see, to make you strong... <br>
            In good time.</i> <br>
            </p>

            <p><i>Kindness freely given away, <br>
                Unnoticed now, will somehow find its way <br>
                Back to you and come to <br>
                In good time. <br>
                </i></p>

                <p><i>Efforts seem not to pay to plan? <br>
                    Forge on friend, doing the best you can. <br>
                    Fortune will find the deserving man... <br>
                    In good time. <br>
                    </i></p>

                    <p><i>Life can be tough, there's no doubt,<br>
                        But hope is the thing we can't do without. <br>
                        Right things with joy will come about... <br>
                        In good time.
